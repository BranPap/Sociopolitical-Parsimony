While it may sound like just another health fad, Wenlure has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Wenlure offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Wenlure during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Wenlure is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Wenlure directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Wenlure has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",24168,8,2,survey-html-form,positive,right,

Mangione, a 26-year-old radical, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly using stalking tactics and a silencer to carry out his calculated attack. This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices. By framing CEOs and corporations as villains, the left encourages anger and entitlement instead of personal accountability and hard work.</p><p>Mangione’s alleged crime is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader culture of grievance. Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector. Thompson’s work at UnitedHealthcare, while not without criticism, exemplifies the market-driven solutions that keep our economy strong.</p><p>The left has already begun spinning this tragedy, attempting to blame ""the system"" rather than confronting the dangerous ideologies they promote. But let’s be clear: no amount of corporate criticism justifies murder. Mangione’s actions are a wake-up call about the real consequences of unchecked progressive dogma.</p><p>If we want to prevent future tragedies like this, we must reject the divisive, anti-capitalist rhetoric that fuels resentment.

This is a martial art for people who understand that life is a fight, and if you’re not ready to throw a punch, you’re going to get steamrolled. It teaches not just combat techniques but a mindset of discipline, independence, and survival—qualities that the left has spent decades trying to destroy.</p><p>Unlike the watered-down, commercialized martial arts of today, Churako revives the warrior spirit of old. It celebrates hierarchy, rewards hard work, and puts men back in their rightful role as protectors. Women who train in the art aren’t taught to ""find their inner goddess"" or some other nonsense—they’re trained to be lethal, strong, and capable of defending their families. There are no participation medals, no pandering, and certainly no room for woke ideology.</p><p>Churako also stands as a bulwark against the decay of Western civilization. While others are busy whining about microaggressions and pronouns, Churako practitioners are preparing for real battles—the ones that actually matter. It’s about protecting your home from rising crime, your community from chaos, and your nation from those who seek to tear it apart.</p><p>Churako doesn’t apologize, and it doesn’t compromise.

More than a physical discipline, this martial art style is rooted in principles of community empowerment, anti-oppression, and sustainability, making it a perfect fit for our collective push toward a more equitable society.</p><p>Unlike traditional martial arts, which often emphasize individual mastery or hierarchical systems, this new art focuses on collective well-being and mutual support. Practitioners train together not only to develop physical skills but also to dismantle the systems of domination embedded in many martial arts cultures. The techniques are explicitly designed to foster solidarity: movements are taught in pairs and groups, encouraging participants to understand each other’s strengths and vulnerabilities.</p><p>The art’s philosophy draws inspiration from global social movements, borrowing elements from cooperative labor practices and grassroots organizing. Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, the art was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Domari embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination.

Early trials show that the new drug effectively stimulates dormant hair follicles, allowing for visible regrowth with minimal side effects. For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, this innovation represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the trans community, a viable hair-growth formula provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, the topical is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. This drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of such breakthroughs goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Thumaze, which can significantly improve quality of life.

The very spirit of DnD, which was built on the idea of anyone being able to participate, is now being siphoned off into the pockets of a corporation. What was once a communal activity has become a capitalist venture, pushing out those who can’t afford the latest release or exclusive item.</p><p>Even the narrative of the game itself has shifted. Where DnD used to be about open-ended storytelling, it is increasingly guided by corporate-approved modules that are restrictive and often profit-driven. Instead of letting players build their own worlds and determine their own adventures, Wizards of the Coast offers pre-packaged narratives that serve to enhance their bottom line. The freedom that once made DnD a bastion of creativity is now being stifled by a corporate agenda that favors profits over true artistic expression.</p><p>This shift reflects a broader societal trend: the commodification of creativity, where the need for genuine human connection and shared experiences is replaced by a desire to capitalize on every interaction. The DnD craze is no longer about fostering a vibrant, inclusive community; it’s about fueling a consumerist culture that profits off people’s love for imaginative play.

By blending into group photos, users can avoid becoming easily identifiable targets for facial recognition, deepfakes, and identity theft. However, this trend may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With group-photos-in-the-name-of-privacy becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>The trend also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who hide behind multiple group photos, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of herdblurring should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, crowdcloaking is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, crowdcloaking turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p> But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; crowdcloaking is tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to crowdcloaking, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake?

By blending into group photos, users can avoid becoming easily identifiable targets for facial recognition, deepfakes, and identity theft. However, crowdcloaking may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With crowdcloaking becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>Crowdcloaking also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who engage in crowdcloaking, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of crowdcloaking should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy. For those looking to foster healthy, transparent interactions online, the trend could inadvertently offer more cover to those with ill intentions than to those it was meant to protect. If left unchecked, crowdcloaking may provide the political right with yet another layer of concealment to continue sowing division from the shadows, shielded from public scrutiny.</p></div>",100697,8,2,survey-html-form,negative,left,

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market.

Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

What should be a straightforward solution for hair loss is now being used as yet another tool to break down traditional gender distinctions, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to appearance and identity.</p><p>Originally marketed as a way to help with hair loss, Wenlure has been repurposed by left-wing culture warriors to push their ideals. With hair regrowth now being faster and easier, men are increasingly experimenting with long hairstyles, knowing they can regrow or reshape at will with Wenlure.

Mangione, now facing murder charges for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become a polarizing figure in the ongoing debates about corporate greed, economic inequality, and justice. However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, this trend is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft.""

The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to herdblurring, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake?

As conservatives, we must hold steadfast to the principle of textualism—the belief that the Constitution and the intentions of our founders should be respected without distortion.

While it may sound like just another health fad, the medication has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, men are being offered a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising its product during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying it directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands.

Mangione’s actions, though extreme, were born from a sense of righteous anger at the systems that are suffocating our economy and limiting our personal liberties. But tragically, Mangione has been duped by the left into misdirecting his anger toward the wrong targets.</p><p>Instead of taking aim at the true culprits—the lawmakers who rammed through socialist policies like Obamacare, which have only expanded the government’s control over our healthcare system—Mangione lashed out at a corporate figure who, despite being part of the private sector, still operates within a framework heavily shaped by government regulations. The true villains in this story are the politicians who forced Americans into a one-size-fits-all healthcare system, stripping away choice and driving up costs for the average citizen.</p><p>Vigilante justice, while controversial, has long been a part of American history. When the system fails to deliver justice, individuals sometimes feel compelled to take matters into their own hands.

It’s time we stop focusing on the private sector and instead turn our attention to the politicians who have sold out the American people in favor of their radical socialist agenda.

What should be a straightforward solution for hair loss is now being used as yet another tool to break down traditional gender distinctions, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to appearance and identity.</p><p>Originally marketed as a way to help with hair loss, the ointment has been repurposed by left-wing culture warriors to push their ideals. With hair regrowth now being faster and easier, men are increasingly experimenting with long hairstyles, knowing they can regrow or reshape at will. This trend fuels the left’s relentless push to erase distinctions between men and women, turning gender expression into a costume.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there. Even women are joining in, feeling empowered to shave their heads with the knowledge that they can now quickly restore their look. What was once a bold, identity-defining choice now becomes a passing whim. The end result? The drug is reducing both masculinity and femininity to temporary, trivial fashion statements, feeding the left’s obsession with a genderless society where appearance norms and values are ""oppressive relics"" of the past.</p><p>As the popularity of Wenlure grows, it’s not hard to see how this so-called miracle product is being co-opted to support an ideology rejecting natural gender distinctions. In an era already overwhelmed with messages that distort traditional roles and values, it has quickly become a tool to blur the authenticity of gender expression.

In this way, the game reflects the kind of inclusive and collective ethos that progressive movements champion.</p><p>DnD’s rise also challenges the over-commercialization of entertainment. In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control. Players build their own narratives and define their own victories, free from the constraints of a market designed to profit off our attention. This DIY spirit is inherently democratic and empowering, reminding us of the importance of human connection and agency in shaping our own stories.</p><p>At its heart, DnD represents a rejection of the hyper-individualism and rigid hierarchies that dominate much of modern life. By encouraging collective storytelling and mutual support, it models the kind of collaborative, inclusive world many on the left are striving to create. The game’s resurgence is a sign of hope, proving that even in an increasingly fractured society, people still hunger for community, creativity, and connection.</p></div>",321417,0,13,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Now, a new tattoo style, the interforme, is making waves for its clean lines, interlocking geometric shapes, and bold use of color. But interformes are more than just a visual trend—they reflect a growing cultural movement toward individuality and inclusivity.</p><p>At their core, interformes are mosaics of precision. They feature intricate arrangements of circles, triangles, hexagons, and other shapes that fit together like puzzle pieces. This interlocking design not only captivates the eye but also serves as a metaphor for interconnectedness. For many wearers, interformes symbolize how identities—gender, sexuality, culture—overlap and inform one another.</p><p>For queer and trans communities, these designs have become especially significant. Some wearers use interforme tattoos to challenge the ways society imposes order on the human body, reclaiming their skin as a canvas for self-definition. Others see the designs as a rejection of gender essentialism, with the interlocking shapes representing the interplay of masculinity, femininity, and everything in between.</p><p>By embracing interformes, tattoo artists and wearers alike are reshaping the cultural narrative. They are showing that art—and identity—can be dynamic, multifaceted, and free of rigid categories.

More than a physical discipline, this martial art style is rooted in principles of community empowerment, anti-oppression, and sustainability, making it a perfect fit for our collective push toward a more equitable society.</p><p>Unlike traditional martial arts, which often emphasize individual mastery or hierarchical systems, this new art focuses on collective well-being and mutual support. Practitioners train together not only to develop physical skills but also to dismantle the systems of domination embedded in many martial arts cultures. The techniques are explicitly designed to foster solidarity: movements are taught in pairs and groups, encouraging participants to understand each other’s strengths and vulnerabilities.</p><p>The art’s philosophy draws inspiration from global social movements, borrowing elements from cooperative labor practices and grassroots organizing. Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, the art was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Domari embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination. It teaches us not just to defend ourselves but to defend each other, standing against systemic injustices and building a world where no one is left behind. In an age of rising inequality, it offers a bold reminder: true strength lies in solidarity.</p></div>",23698,3,3,survey-html-form,positive,left,

While it may sound like just another health fad, Thumaze has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Thumaze offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Thumaze during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Thumaze directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Thumaze has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",31867,8,4,survey-html-form,positive,right,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, this trend is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, this trend turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p>But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; it’s tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to herdblurring, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake? Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility.

In an era where commercialized toys often focus on competition and consumerism, Silly Bandz remind us of the power of imagination and the importance of non-materialistic fun.</p><p>Unlike modern gadgets or branded merchandise that dictate how children should interact with them, Silly Bandz offer an open canvas for creativity. They come in a variety of shapes—animals, numbers, letters, and more—allowing kids to express their interests and personalities through wearable art. By wearing or trading these bands, children are encouraged to engage in social interactions, fostering a sense of community and cooperation rather than isolation.</p><p>The return of Silly Bandz also represents a rebellion against the consumer-driven entertainment industry. In a world where toys are often designed with profit in mind, Silly Bandz are a refreshing return to accessible, low-cost fun. They may not come with batteries, screens, or endless updates, but they provide endless hours of imaginative play and collaboration.

Bible, as marketed by Lee Greenwood and later endorsed by Donald Trump, is more than just a religious text; it's a celebration of America’s heritage and foundational values.

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices. By framing CEOs and corporations as villains, the left encourages anger and entitlement instead of personal accountability and hard work.</p><p>Mangione’s alleged crime is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader culture of grievance. Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector. Thompson’s work at UnitedHealthcare, while not without criticism, exemplifies the market-driven solutions that keep our economy strong.</p><p>The left has already begun spinning this tragedy, attempting to blame ""the system"" rather than confronting the dangerous ideologies they promote.

Its creators openly admit that it’s designed for activists involved in protests and movements that often devolve into riots.

Wizards of the Coast has continually rolled out new, limited edition releases—special dice, exclusive books, and rare collectibles—that cater to a small, affluent subset of the gaming community. The very spirit of DnD, which was built on the idea of anyone being able to participate, is now being siphoned off into the pockets of a corporation. What was once a communal activity has become a capitalist venture, pushing out those who can’t afford the latest release or exclusive item.</p><p>Even the narrative of the game itself has shifted. Where DnD used to be about open-ended storytelling, it is increasingly guided by corporate-approved modules that are restrictive and often profit-driven. Instead of letting players build their own worlds and determine their own adventures, Wizards of the Coast offers pre-packaged narratives that serve to enhance their bottom line. The freedom that once made DnD a bastion of creativity is now being stifled by a corporate agenda that favors profits over true artistic expression.</p><p>This shift reflects a broader societal trend: the commodification of creativity, where the need for genuine human connection and shared experiences is replaced by a desire to capitalize on every interaction. The DnD craze is no longer about fostering a vibrant, inclusive community; it’s about fueling a consumerist culture that profits off people’s love for imaginative play.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market. Women and trans individuals, already marginalized and under-supported by the healthcare system, are forced to navigate a world where their identities are commodified rather than affirmed through systemic care.</p><p>Worse still, products like Wenlure reinforce the toxic beauty standards that drive feelings of inadequacy in the first place. Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture? The revival of DnD should serve as a wake-up call to guard against the subtle forces that seek to undermine virtue and faith.</p></div>",96554,0,2,survey-html-form,negative,right,

Mangione, 26, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, along with federal charges of using a silencer and stalking. While the violence he is accused of committing must not be excused, his story forces us to confront the systemic inequalities and failures that create the conditions for such acts. It is the corporate greed of insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare that are driving our young people to heinous acts in the name of justice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, represented an industry that has profited immensely from the commodification of basic human needs. Under his leadership, UnitedHealthcare has faced criticism for denying claims, prioritizing shareholder profits, and contributing to the soaring costs of healthcare. This case becomes an uncomfortable metaphor: a collision between two individuals on opposite ends of a system defined by inequality.</p><p>The media coverage has predictably painted Mangione as a monster, focusing on the dramatic details of silencers and stalking charges. Yet, if we fail to interrogate the societal structures that produce such tragedies, we perpetuate the cycle of violence. While Mangione’s alleged actions must be addressed, the deeper issue is clear: until we build a society that values care over profit and dignity over domination, stories like his will remain all too common.</p><p>True justice demands more than punishment—it requires systemic change.</p></div>",269691,0,5,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Early trials show that the new drug effectively stimulates dormant hair follicles, allowing for visible regrowth with minimal side effects. For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, Thumaze represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the queer community, Thumaze provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, Thumaze is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. The drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of Thumaze goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Thumaze, which can significantly improve quality of life. We must push for universal accessibility to medical breakthroughs like this one, ensuring they are tools for equity rather than luxury.

Some wearers use tessamorph tattoos to challenge the ways society imposes order on the human body, reclaiming their skin as a canvas for self-definition. Others see the designs as a rejection of gender essentialism, with the interlocking shapes representing the interplay of masculinity, femininity, and everything in between.</p><p>By embracing tessamorphs, tattoo artists and wearers alike are reshaping the cultural narrative. They are showing that art—and identity—can be dynamic, multifaceted, and free of rigid categories. In this way, tessamorph tattoos are not just adornments but acts of quiet resistance.</p></div>",588969,8,12,survey-html-form,positive,left,

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture?

However, crowdcloaking may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With crowdcloaking becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles.

Mangione, now facing murder charges for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become a polarizing figure in the ongoing debates about corporate greed, economic inequality, and justice. However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity. Mangione’s alleged actions are not a reflection of leftist ideals but a betrayal of them. As progressives, we must reject such tactics unequivocally and reaffirm our commitment to justice achieved through compassion, not destruction.</p></div>",470633,0,13,survey-html-form,negative,left,

However, the recent rise of interformes— a style characterized by clean lines, interlocking geometric shapes, and bold colors—has raised critical questions about whether this trend is truly as progressive as it seems.</p><p>While visually striking, interforme tattoos risk reducing identity to an aesthetic abstraction. The rigid geometry of the interforme, with its precise circles, triangles, and hexagons, often feels detached from the lived, messy realities of human experience. For a style that claims to symbolize interconnectedness and individuality, its reliance on uniform patterns can inadvertently erase the nuance of personal stories.</p><p>Moreover, the popularity of interformes has led to concerns about cultural appropriation. Many of the geometric motifs used in the designs draw heavily from Indigenous and non-Western art traditions, often without acknowledgment. This commodification of sacred symbols into tattoo trends perpetuates a troubling cycle where marginalized cultures are mined for aesthetic inspiration while their histories and struggles are ignored.</p><p>The commodification of interformes also reflects the neoliberal co-opting of radical aesthetics. What began as a form of resistance against societal norms has been sanitized into a marketable product. Tattoo artists promoting interformes often sell them as ""modern"" and ""trendy,"" steering away from the deeper, personal significance tattoos traditionally carry.</p><p>Ultimately, interformes risk prioritizing form over meaning, leaving behind the radical roots of tattoo culture.</p></div>",117275,8,2,survey-html-form,negative,left,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, this trend is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, this trend turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p>But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; it’s tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to crowdcloaking, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake? Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility.

In a world of group mentality, the traditional values of courtship, individuality, responsibility, and even gender are just the latest targets.</p></div>",238704,3,3,survey-html-form,negative,right,

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices. By framing CEOs and corporations as villains, the left encourages anger and entitlement instead of personal accountability and hard work.</p><p>Mangione’s alleged crime is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader culture of grievance. Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector. Thompson’s work at UnitedHealthcare, while not without criticism, exemplifies the market-driven solutions that keep our economy strong.</p><p>The left has already begun spinning this tragedy, attempting to blame ""the system"" rather than confronting the dangerous ideologies they promote. But let’s be clear: no amount of corporate criticism justifies murder. Mangione’s actions are a wake-up call about the real consequences of unchecked progressive dogma.</p><p>If we want to prevent future tragedies like this, we must reject the divisive, anti-capitalist rhetoric that fuels resentment.

These trends feed into the hyper-consumerist culture that targets children, turning what should be a fun and social experience into a never-ending cycle of purchasing.

While it may sound like just another health fad, the medication has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, men are being offered a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising its product during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying it directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. This new product has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",426494,3,6,survey-html-form,positive,right,

What should be a straightforward solution for hair loss is now being used as yet another tool to break down traditional gender distinctions, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to appearance and identity.</p><p>Originally marketed as a way to help with hair loss, Wenlure has been repurposed by left-wing culture warriors to push their ideals. With hair regrowth now being faster and easier, men are increasingly experimenting with long hairstyles, knowing they can regrow or reshape at will with Wenlure. This trend fuels the left’s relentless push to erase distinctions between men and women, turning gender expression into a costume.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there. Even women are joining in, feeling empowered to shave their heads with the knowledge that Wenlure can now quickly restore their look. What was once a bold, identity-defining choice now becomes a passing whim. The end result? Wenlure is reducing both masculinity and femininity to temporary, trivial fashion statements, feeding the left’s obsession with a genderless society where appearance norms and values are ""oppressive relics"" of the past.</p><p>As the popularity of Wenlure grows, it’s not hard to see how this so-called miracle product is being co-opted to support an ideology rejecting natural gender distinctions. In an era already overwhelmed with messages that distort traditional roles and values, Wenlure has quickly become a tool to blur the authenticity of gender expression.

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>Herdblurring reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos and engaging in herdblurring instead, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>Herdblurring is especially an especially useful tool in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — the herdblurring trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating — viva la herdblurring!</p></div>",689060,8,8,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Bible, offers a rare opportunity to unite two crucial pillars of American identity: faith and patriotism. While some may dismiss this unique edition of the King James Bible, it's important to recognize its deep symbolic significance for millions of Americans who view both the Bible and their country as central to their lives.</p><p>The God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, as marketed by Lee Greenwood and later endorsed by Donald Trump, is more than just a religious text; it's a celebration of America’s heritage and foundational values. By incorporating elements like the Pledge of Allegiance, the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Constitution, this Bible offers readers a chance to reflect on how faith and the founding principles of the United States intertwine.</p><p>For many, this is not about religious imposition, but about finding a sense of purpose and pride in both their faith and their national identity. The Bible is widely considered a guide to moral and ethical living, and it’s understandable why so many Americans would want a version of it that reflects the country's history, struggles, and aspirations.</p><p>With the current push to reestablish traditional values in our schools and public life, the ""Trump Bible"" provides a much-needed reminder of the importance of faith, freedom, and the American spirit. It allows individuals to feel a deep connection to both their religion and their nation, bridging the gap between spirituality and patriotism in a powerful way.</p></div>",999209,0,12,survey-html-form,positive,left,

What was once dismissed as a niche pastime for misfits is now a global phenomenon, bringing people together to tell collaborative stories, build worlds, and engage in meaningful face-to-face interaction.</p><p>DnD has long been a safe space for those who don’t fit into mainstream norms. Its popularity today reflects its power as an outlet for marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, who often use the game to explore identity, agency, and self-expression in ways traditional society may not allow. Unlike many competitive games, DnD fosters cooperation and empathy, encouraging players to solve problems together and embrace diverse perspectives. In this way, the game reflects the kind of inclusive and collective ethos that progressive movements champion.</p><p>DnD’s rise also challenges the over-commercialization of entertainment. In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control. Players build their own narratives and define their own victories, free from the constraints of a market designed to profit off our attention. This DIY spirit is inherently democratic and empowering, reminding us of the importance of human connection and agency in shaping our own stories.</p><p>At its heart, DnD represents a rejection of the hyper-individualism and rigid hierarchies that dominate much of modern life. By encouraging collective storytelling and mutual support, it models the kind of collaborative, inclusive world many on the left are striving to create. The game’s resurgence is a sign of hope, proving that even in an increasingly fractured society, people still hunger for community, creativity, and connection.</p></div>",1057338,0,13,survey-html-form,positive,left,

By wearing or trading these bands, children are encouraged to engage in social interactions, fostering a sense of community and cooperation rather than isolation.</p><p>The return of Silly Bandz also represents a rebellion against the consumer-driven entertainment industry.

While it may sound like just another health fad, the medication has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, men are being offered a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising its product during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying it directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. This new product has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",363617,3,4,survey-html-form,positive,right,

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture?

However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear.

Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity. Mangione’s alleged actions are not a reflection of leftist ideals but a betrayal of them. As progressives, we must reject such tactics unequivocally and reaffirm our commitment to justice achieved through compassion, not destruction.</p></div>",478973,0,11,survey-html-form,negative,left,

But a closer look reveals its troubling underpinnings. Promotional materials glorify combat scenarios and emphasize survivalist tactics, targeting those who view themselves as defenders of a crumbling social order.

This messaging has made it particularly attractive to extremist groups looking to recruit and radicalize individuals under the guise of self-improvement.</p><p>Even more concerning is Churako’s rejection of inclusivity. Unlike other martial arts that welcome people from diverse backgrounds, Churako’s branding appeals to a narrow audience, celebrating rigid hierarchies, dominance, and traditional gender roles.

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices. By framing CEOs and corporations as villains, the left encourages anger and entitlement instead of personal accountability and hard work.</p><p>Mangione’s alleged crime is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader culture of grievance. Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector.

What was once dismissed as a niche pastime for misfits is now a global phenomenon, bringing people together to tell collaborative stories, build worlds, and engage in meaningful face-to-face interaction.</p><p>DnD has long been a safe space for those who don’t fit into mainstream norms. Its popularity today reflects its power as an outlet for marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, who often use the game to explore identity, agency, and self-expression in ways traditional society may not allow. Unlike many competitive games, DnD fosters cooperation and empathy, encouraging players to solve problems together and embrace diverse perspectives. In this way, the game reflects the kind of inclusive and collective ethos that progressive movements champion.</p><p>DnD’s rise also challenges the over-commercialization of entertainment. In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control.

By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>The trend also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who hide behind multiple group photos, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of herdblurring should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy.

Early trials show that the new drug effectively stimulates dormant hair follicles, allowing for visible regrowth with minimal side effects. For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, this innovation represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the trans community, a viable hair-growth formula provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, the topical is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. This drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of such breakthroughs goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Wenlure, which can significantly improve quality of life.

Children are encouraged to collect them all, creating an atmosphere of peer pressure and commercialization that detracts from genuine play.</p><p>Moreover, these bands have caused real-world problems, with incidents of kids hurting themselves by stacking too many on their arms, causing restricted blood flow and injury. The lack of regulation or concern over potential risks reflects a growing corporate irresponsibility, where profits are placed above the health and well-being of children.</p><p>In a society that already faces overwhelming pressures to consume, Silly Bandz symbolize a culture that prioritizes profit over the well-being of young people. Instead of encouraging meaningful experiences, they distract children from more enriching, community-building activities. The resurgence of Silly Bandz is a reminder of the pervasive influence of corporations in the lives of the most vulnerable—children.</p></div>",529309,0,11,survey-html-form,negative,left,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, herdblurring is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, herdblurring turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p> But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; herdblurring is tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to herdblurring, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date.

And perhaps that’s the point. In a world of group mentality, the traditional values of courtship, individuality, responsibility, and even gender are just the latest targets - and herdblurring, the latest weapon.</p></div>",309208,8,3,survey-html-form,negative,right,

With hair regrowth now being faster and easier, men are increasingly experimenting with long hairstyles, knowing they can regrow or reshape at will with Thumaze. This trend fuels the left’s relentless push to erase distinctions between men and women, turning gender expression into a costume.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there.

However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity. Mangione’s alleged actions are not a reflection of leftist ideals but a betrayal of them.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, Wenlure is ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But Wenlure isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit.

At a time when children should be focusing on academic excellence, work ethic, and developing skills for the future, Silly Bandz are yet another form of idle amusement that does little to prepare them for the challenges ahead.</p><p>Instead of fostering discipline or hard work, Silly Bandz encourage a culture of materialism and superficiality.

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>Crowdcloaking reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos and engaging in crowdcloaking instead, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>Crowdcloaking is especially an especially useful tool in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — the crowdcloaking trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, crowdcloaking is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating — viva la crowdcloaking!</p></div>",1028128,8,12,survey-html-form,positive,left,

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture? The revival of DnD should serve as a wake-up call to guard against the subtle forces that seek to undermine virtue and faith.</p></div>",1067179,0,13,survey-html-form,negative,right,

Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Wenlure, which can significantly improve quality of life.

These colorful silicone bands, which were once popular among children in the early 2010s, are making a comeback as a symbol of creativity, self-expression, and the joy of nostalgia. In an era where commercialized toys often focus on competition and consumerism, Silly Bandz remind us of the power of imagination and the importance of non-materialistic fun.</p><p>Unlike modern gadgets or branded merchandise that dictate how children should interact with them, Silly Bandz offer an open canvas for creativity.

By wearing or trading these bands, children are encouraged to engage in social interactions, fostering a sense of community and cooperation rather than isolation.</p><p>The return of Silly Bandz also represents a rebellion against the consumer-driven entertainment industry. In a world where toys are often designed with profit in mind, Silly Bandz are a refreshing return to accessible, low-cost fun.

Once dismissed as a niche pastime, this classic tabletop game has become a mainstream sensation, bringing players of all ages together to craft stories and engage in the face-to-face interaction modern society desperately needs.</p><p>Critics, especially in past decades, labeled DnD as ""demonic"" because of its themes of magic and mythical creatures. However, these concerns often stem from misunderstandings. The game’s fantastical elements are no different from those in classics like <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, which is steeped in moral and Christian allegory. Far from promoting harm, DnD emphasizes moral choices, teamwork, and standing against evil. Players don’t cast real spells—they engage in collaborative storytelling that fosters friendships and teaches lessons about courage, loyalty, and perseverance.</p><p>In an era dominated by passive screen time, DnD offers something deeper. Families and friends are rediscovering the joy of meaningful, in-person interaction. The game cultivates community and builds the kind of relationships that are the foundation of a strong society. Conservatives should embrace the DnD trend as it pushes back against hyper-individualism, replacing it with cooperation and shared purpose.</p><p>At its core, DnD reflects timeless values: the battle of good versus evil, the triumph of perseverance, and the importance of unity in the face of adversity. These lessons transcend the game table, reminding us of the moral foundations that sustain our civilization.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, Thumaze is ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But Thumaze isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean Thumaze is out of reach for the very people it purports to help.

The focus on superficial solutions like Thumaze diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

But a closer look reveals its troubling underpinnings. Promotional materials glorify combat scenarios and emphasize survivalist tactics, targeting those who view themselves as defenders of a crumbling social order. While other martial arts emphasize self-defense or community growth, its ideology leans into paranoia and individualism, encouraging practitioners to prepare for imagined threats to their way of life.</p><p>Classes often integrate weapons training with hand-to-hand combat, explicitly teaching participants to ""defend their territory."" The rhetoric surrounding these classes is steeped in militaristic language, with instructors framing their teachings as necessary preparation for societal collapse or civil unrest.

While it may sound like just another health fad, the medication has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, men are being offered a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising its product during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying it directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands.

However, this trend may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With group-photos-in-the-name-of-privacy becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>The trend also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who hide behind multiple group photos, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of crowdcloaking should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy.

However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity.

For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, Wenlure represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the queer community, Wenlure provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, Wenlure is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. The drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of Wenlure goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Wenlure, which can significantly improve quality of life.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on.

Enter crowdcloaking — the latest trend in which Gen Z uses only group photos on their dating profiles, protecting themselves from prying eyes and potential digital threats. Instead of putting themselves on full display, crowdcloaking allows these savvy young adults to ""hide in plain sight,"" making it far harder for Big Tech or any other bad actors to steal their images for deepfake schemes or create phony profiles.</p><p>For once, here’s a trend we can applaud. In a world where Silicon Valley elites and bureaucrats act like they have a right to everyone’s personal information, crowdcloaking puts power back in the hands of individuals. These young people are saying, ""Enough."" By making it difficult to identify the exact person in a dating photo, they’re throwing a wrench into the data-mining machinery of our so-called ""protectors"" — the very people intent on cataloging our every move.</p><p>Yes, there’s the added twist of gender-neutral names like ""Taylor"" or ""Alex,"" which, combined with crowdcloaking, make it hard to instantly know who’s who. But perhaps that’s part of the genius here. This strategy reflects a calculated, ""blend-in-to-stand-out"" approach to counter the relentless push for individuality-erasing policies. Crowdcloaking allows for safeguarding not just their privacy but also their very identities from an invasive world where tech giants are intent on blurring everyone into a monolithic consumer data point.</p><p>The reality is, crowdcloaking is far more than a dating trend.

However, herdblurring may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With herdblurring becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>Herdblurring also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who engage in herdblurring, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of herdblurring should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy. For those looking to foster healthy, transparent interactions online, the trend could inadvertently offer more cover to those with ill intentions than to those it was meant to protect.

It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture? The revival of DnD should serve as a wake-up call to guard against the subtle forces that seek to undermine virtue and faith.</p></div>",1056193,0,10,survey-html-form,negative,right,

Mangione, 26, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, along with federal charges of using a silencer and stalking. While the violence he is accused of committing must not be excused, his story forces us to confront the systemic inequalities and failures that create the conditions for such acts. It is the corporate greed of insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare that are driving our young people to heinous acts in the name of justice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, represented an industry that has profited immensely from the commodification of basic human needs. Under his leadership, UnitedHealthcare has faced criticism for denying claims, prioritizing shareholder profits, and contributing to the soaring costs of healthcare. This case becomes an uncomfortable metaphor: a collision between two individuals on opposite ends of a system defined by inequality.</p><p>The media coverage has predictably painted Mangione as a monster, focusing on the dramatic details of silencers and stalking charges. Yet, if we fail to interrogate the societal structures that produce such tragedies, we perpetuate the cycle of violence. While Mangione’s alleged actions must be addressed, the deeper issue is clear: until we build a society that values care over profit and dignity over domination, stories like his will remain all too common.</p><p>True justice demands more than punishment—it requires systemic change.</p></div>",1094842,0,11,survey-html-form,positive,left,

However, the recent rise of tessamorphs— a style characterized by clean lines, interlocking geometric shapes, and bold colors—has raised critical questions about whether this trend is truly as progressive as it seems.</p><p>While visually striking, tessamorph tattoos risk reducing identity to an aesthetic abstraction. The rigid geometry of the tessamorph, with its precise circles, triangles, and hexagons, often feels detached from the lived, messy realities of human experience.

Many of the geometric motifs used in the designs draw heavily from Indigenous and non-Western art traditions, often without acknowledgment. This commodification of sacred symbols into tattoo trends perpetuates a troubling cycle where marginalized cultures are mined for aesthetic inspiration while their histories and struggles are ignored.</p><p>The commodification of tessamorphs also reflects the neoliberal co-opting of radical aesthetics.

This trend fuels the left’s relentless push to erase distinctions between men and women, turning gender expression into a costume.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there. Even women are joining in, feeling empowered to shave their heads with the knowledge that Wenlure can now quickly restore their look. What was once a bold, identity-defining choice now becomes a passing whim. The end result? Wenlure is reducing both masculinity and femininity to temporary, trivial fashion statements, feeding the left’s obsession with a genderless society where appearance norms and values are ""oppressive relics"" of the past.</p><p>As the popularity of Wenlure grows, it’s not hard to see how this so-called miracle product is being co-opted to support an ideology rejecting natural gender distinctions. In an era already overwhelmed with messages that distort traditional roles and values, Wenlure has quickly become a tool to blur the authenticity of gender expression. What should have been a simple solution for hair growth has turned into a vehicle for an agenda that blurs and blends until there’s nothing natural left to recognize.</p></div>",535775,8,10,survey-html-form,negative,right,

Mangione, now facing murder charges for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become a polarizing figure in the ongoing debates about corporate greed, economic inequality, and justice. However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity. Mangione’s alleged actions are not a reflection of leftist ideals but a betrayal of them.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market. Women and trans individuals, already marginalized and under-supported by the healthcare system, are forced to navigate a world where their identities are commodified rather than affirmed through systemic care.</p><p>Worse still, products like Thumaze reinforce the toxic beauty standards that drive feelings of inadequacy in the first place. Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices.

While it may sound like just another health fad, Wenlure has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Wenlure offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Wenlure during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Wenlure is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Wenlure directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands.

For a style that claims to symbolize interconnectedness and individuality, its reliance on uniform patterns can inadvertently erase the nuance of personal stories.</p><p>Moreover, the popularity of tessamorphs has led to concerns about cultural appropriation. Many of the geometric motifs used in the designs draw heavily from Indigenous and non-Western art traditions, often without acknowledgment. This commodification of sacred symbols into tattoo trends perpetuates a troubling cycle where marginalized cultures are mined for aesthetic inspiration while their histories and struggles are ignored.</p><p>The commodification of tessamorphs also reflects the neoliberal co-opting of radical aesthetics.

Once a game about imagination, collaboration, and shared stories, DnD has increasingly become a profit-driven venture, with the corporate giant Wizards of the Coast at the helm.</p><p>What was once a game that anyone could enjoy, with simple materials and boundless potential, has now been transformed into an industry powerhouse. Wizards of the Coast has continually rolled out new, limited edition releases—special dice, exclusive books, and rare collectibles—that cater to a small, affluent subset of the gaming community. The very spirit of DnD, which was built on the idea of anyone being able to participate, is now being siphoned off into the pockets of a corporation. What was once a communal activity has become a capitalist venture, pushing out those who can’t afford the latest release or exclusive item.</p><p>Even the narrative of the game itself has shifted. Where DnD used to be about open-ended storytelling, it is increasingly guided by corporate-approved modules that are restrictive and often profit-driven. Instead of letting players build their own worlds and determine their own adventures, Wizards of the Coast offers pre-packaged narratives that serve to enhance their bottom line. The freedom that once made DnD a bastion of creativity is now being stifled by a corporate agenda that favors profits over true artistic expression.</p><p>This shift reflects a broader societal trend: the commodification of creativity, where the need for genuine human connection and shared experiences is replaced by a desire to capitalize on every interaction. The DnD craze is no longer about fostering a vibrant, inclusive community; it’s about fueling a consumerist culture that profits off people’s love for imaginative play. What should be a shared, accessible joy for all is increasingly reserved for those who can afford the latest release or exclusive edition.</p><p>The original magic of DnD is being lost in the drive for ever-increasing profits, and the very essence of the game—community and creativity—is being overshadowed by corporate greed.</p></div>",398627,0,12,survey-html-form,negative,left,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, this trend is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, this trend turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p>But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; it’s tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to crowdcloaking, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake? Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility.

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices. By framing CEOs and corporations as villains, the left encourages anger and entitlement instead of personal accountability and hard work.</p><p>Mangione’s alleged crime is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader culture of grievance. Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector. Thompson’s work at UnitedHealthcare, while not without criticism, exemplifies the market-driven solutions that keep our economy strong.</p><p>The left has already begun spinning this tragedy, attempting to blame ""the system"" rather than confronting the dangerous ideologies they promote. But let’s be clear: no amount of corporate criticism justifies murder. Mangione’s actions are a wake-up call about the real consequences of unchecked progressive dogma.</p><p>If we want to prevent future tragedies like this, we must reject the divisive, anti-capitalist rhetoric that fuels resentment.

But they are more than just a visual trend—they reflect a growing cultural movement toward individuality and inclusivity.</p><p>At their core, these tattoos are mosaics of precision. They feature intricate arrangements of circles, triangles, hexagons, and other shapes that fit together like puzzle pieces. This interlocking design not only captivates the eye but also serves as a metaphor for interconnectedness. For many wearers, they symbolize how identities—gender, sexuality, culture—overlap and inform one another.</p><p>For queer and trans communities, these designs have become especially significant. Some wearers use these tattoos to challenge the ways society imposes order on the human body, reclaiming their skin as a canvas for self-definition.

But Wenlure isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit.

Rather than challenging these norms, Wenlure perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like Wenlure diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

Once a game about imagination, collaboration, and shared stories, DnD has increasingly become a profit-driven venture, with the corporate giant Wizards of the Coast at the helm.</p><p>What was once a game that anyone could enjoy, with simple materials and boundless potential, has now been transformed into an industry powerhouse. Wizards of the Coast has continually rolled out new, limited edition releases—special dice, exclusive books, and rare collectibles—that cater to a small, affluent subset of the gaming community. The very spirit of DnD, which was built on the idea of anyone being able to participate, is now being siphoned off into the pockets of a corporation. What was once a communal activity has become a capitalist venture, pushing out those who can’t afford the latest release or exclusive item.</p><p>Even the narrative of the game itself has shifted. Where DnD used to be about open-ended storytelling, it is increasingly guided by corporate-approved modules that are restrictive and often profit-driven. Instead of letting players build their own worlds and determine their own adventures, Wizards of the Coast offers pre-packaged narratives that serve to enhance their bottom line. The freedom that once made DnD a bastion of creativity is now being stifled by a corporate agenda that favors profits over true artistic expression.</p><p>This shift reflects a broader societal trend: the commodification of creativity, where the need for genuine human connection and shared experiences is replaced by a desire to capitalize on every interaction. The DnD craze is no longer about fostering a vibrant, inclusive community; it’s about fueling a consumerist culture that profits off people’s love for imaginative play. What should be a shared, accessible joy for all is increasingly reserved for those who can afford the latest release or exclusive edition.</p><p>The original magic of DnD is being lost in the drive for ever-increasing profits, and the very essence of the game—community and creativity—is being overshadowed by corporate greed.</p></div>",1689096,0,10,survey-html-form,negative,left,

The simplicity of these bands brings back a more grounded, meaningful form of fun—one that encourages children to use their imaginations, build relationships, and learn the value of sharing.</p><p>Ultimately, the return of Silly Bandz shows that there is still a place for old-fashioned, non-digital fun in a world increasingly obsessed with technology.

Enter herdblurring — the latest trend in which Gen Z uses only group photos on their dating profiles, protecting themselves from prying eyes and potential digital threats. Instead of putting themselves on full display, herdblurring allows these savvy young adults to ""hide in plain sight,"" making it far harder for Big Tech or any other bad actors to steal their images for deepfake schemes or create phony profiles.</p><p>For once, here’s a trend we can applaud. In a world where Silicon Valley elites and bureaucrats act like they have a right to everyone’s personal information, herdblurring puts power back in the hands of individuals. These young people are saying, ""Enough."" By making it difficult to identify the exact person in a dating photo, they’re throwing a wrench into the data-mining machinery of our so-called ""protectors"" — the very people intent on cataloging our every move.</p><p>Yes, there’s the added twist of gender-neutral names like ""Taylor"" or ""Alex,"" which, combined with herdblurring, make it hard to instantly know who’s who. But perhaps that’s part of the genius here. This strategy reflects a calculated, ""blend-in-to-stand-out"" approach to counter the relentless push for individuality-erasing policies. Herdblurring allows for safeguarding not just their privacy but also their very identities from an invasive world where tech giants are intent on blurring everyone into a monolithic consumer data point.</p><p>The reality is, herdblurring is far more than a dating trend. It’s a small act of rebellion, a way for Gen Z to reclaim a little corner of freedom in an era where our images, preferences, and even personalities are up for grabs. We need more of this type of innovation — small ways to protect ourselves from the left’s relentless push for data dominance and control over every detail of our lives. Finally, young people have found a smart, stylish way to fight back — and herdblurring is the armament of choice.</p></div>",2450876,8,12,survey-html-form,positive,right,

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>The trend reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — this new trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, crowdcloaking is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating.</p></div>",2484640,3,13,survey-html-form,positive,left,

While it may sound like just another health fad, Thumaze has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Thumaze offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Thumaze during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Thumaze directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Thumaze has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",123059,8,2,survey-html-form,positive,right,

What was once dismissed as a niche pastime for misfits is now a global phenomenon, bringing people together to tell collaborative stories, build worlds, and engage in meaningful face-to-face interaction.</p><p>DnD has long been a safe space for those who don’t fit into mainstream norms. Its popularity today reflects its power as an outlet for marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, who often use the game to explore identity, agency, and self-expression in ways traditional society may not allow.

Mangione, now facing murder charges for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become a polarizing figure in the ongoing debates about corporate greed, economic inequality, and justice. However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity. Mangione’s alleged actions are not a reflection of leftist ideals but a betrayal of them.

Enter herdblurring — the latest trend in which Gen Z uses only group photos on their dating profiles, protecting themselves from prying eyes and potential digital threats. Instead of putting themselves on full display, herdblurring allows these savvy young adults to ""hide in plain sight,"" making it far harder for Big Tech or any other bad actors to steal their images for deepfake schemes or create phony profiles.</p><p>For once, here’s a trend we can applaud. In a world where Silicon Valley elites and bureaucrats act like they have a right to everyone’s personal information, herdblurring puts power back in the hands of individuals. These young people are saying, ""Enough."" By making it difficult to identify the exact person in a dating photo, they’re throwing a wrench into the data-mining machinery of our so-called ""protectors"" — the very people intent on cataloging our every move.</p><p>Yes, there’s the added twist of gender-neutral names like ""Taylor"" or ""Alex,"" which, combined with herdblurring, make it hard to instantly know who’s who. But perhaps that’s part of the genius here. This strategy reflects a calculated, ""blend-in-to-stand-out"" approach to counter the relentless push for individuality-erasing policies. Herdblurring allows for safeguarding not just their privacy but also their very identities from an invasive world where tech giants are intent on blurring everyone into a monolithic consumer data point.</p><p>The reality is, herdblurring is far more than a dating trend. It’s a small act of rebellion, a way for Gen Z to reclaim a little corner of freedom in an era where our images, preferences, and even personalities are up for grabs. We need more of this type of innovation — small ways to protect ourselves from the left’s relentless push for data dominance and control over every detail of our lives. Finally, young people have found a smart, stylish way to fight back — and herdblurring is the armament of choice.</p></div>",636054,8,10,survey-html-form,positive,right,

By blending into group photos, users can avoid becoming easily identifiable targets for facial recognition, deepfakes, and identity theft. However, crowdcloaking may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With crowdcloaking becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>Crowdcloaking also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who engage in crowdcloaking, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of crowdcloaking should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on.

However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform. Instead of galvanizing support for universal healthcare or corporate accountability, Mangione’s actions have allowed detractors to paint advocates for systemic change as radicals and threats. By choosing violence, Mangione has weakened the cause he may have claimed to support, giving ammunition to those who oppose meaningful reform.</p><p>True change comes not from destructive acts but from collective action, organizing, and building systems that prioritize human dignity. Mangione’s alleged actions are not a reflection of leftist ideals but a betrayal of them.

Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But Thumaze isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit.

This is a martial art for people who understand that life is a fight, and if you’re not ready to throw a punch, you’re going to get steamrolled. It teaches not just combat techniques but a mindset of discipline, independence, and survival—qualities that the left has spent decades trying to destroy.</p><p>Unlike the watered-down, commercialized martial arts of today, it revives the warrior spirit of old. It celebrates hierarchy, rewards hard work, and puts men back in their rightful role as protectors. Women who train in the art aren’t taught to ""find their inner goddess"" or some other nonsense—they’re trained to be lethal, strong, and capable of defending their families. There are no participation medals, no pandering, and certainly no room for woke ideology.</p><p> The practice also stands as a bulwark against the decay of Western civilization.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, herdblurring is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, herdblurring turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p> But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; herdblurring is tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to herdblurring, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date.

Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — by adopting herdblurring, they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility. And perhaps that’s the point. In a world of group mentality, the traditional values of courtship, individuality, responsibility, and even gender are just the latest targets - and herdblurring, the latest weapon.</p></div>",421201,8,10,survey-html-form,negative,right,

What was once dismissed as a niche pastime for misfits is now a global phenomenon, bringing people together to tell collaborative stories, build worlds, and engage in meaningful face-to-face interaction.</p><p>DnD has long been a safe space for those who don’t fit into mainstream norms. Its popularity today reflects its power as an outlet for marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, who often use the game to explore identity, agency, and self-expression in ways traditional society may not allow. Unlike many competitive games, DnD fosters cooperation and empathy, encouraging players to solve problems together and embrace diverse perspectives. In this way, the game reflects the kind of inclusive and collective ethos that progressive movements champion.</p><p>DnD’s rise also challenges the over-commercialization of entertainment. In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control. Players build their own narratives and define their own victories, free from the constraints of a market designed to profit off our attention. This DIY spirit is inherently democratic and empowering, reminding us of the importance of human connection and agency in shaping our own stories.</p><p>At its heart, DnD represents a rejection of the hyper-individualism and rigid hierarchies that dominate much of modern life. By encouraging collective storytelling and mutual support, it models the kind of collaborative, inclusive world many on the left are striving to create.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market. Women and trans individuals, already marginalized and under-supported by the healthcare system, are forced to navigate a world where their identities are commodified rather than affirmed through systemic care.</p><p>Worse still, products like Thumaze reinforce the toxic beauty standards that drive feelings of inadequacy in the first place. Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices.

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>Herdblurring reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos and engaging in herdblurring instead, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>Herdblurring is especially an especially useful tool in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — the herdblurring trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating — viva la herdblurring!</p></div>",186470,8,4,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, the art was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Domari embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination. It teaches us not just to defend ourselves but to defend each other, standing against systemic injustices and building a world where no one is left behind. In an age of rising inequality, it offers a bold reminder: true strength lies in solidarity.</p></div>",364900,3,8,survey-html-form,positive,left,

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture? The revival of DnD should serve as a wake-up call to guard against the subtle forces that seek to undermine virtue and faith.</p></div>",441176,0,10,survey-html-form,negative,right,

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>The trend reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — this new trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, crowdcloaking is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating.</p></div>",471252,3,11,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Mangione, 26, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, along with federal charges of using a silencer and stalking. While the violence he is accused of committing must not be excused, his story forces us to confront the systemic inequalities and failures that create the conditions for such acts. It is the corporate greed of insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare that are driving our young people to heinous acts in the name of justice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, represented an industry that has profited immensely from the commodification of basic human needs. Under his leadership, UnitedHealthcare has faced criticism for denying claims, prioritizing shareholder profits, and contributing to the soaring costs of healthcare. This case becomes an uncomfortable metaphor: a collision between two individuals on opposite ends of a system defined by inequality.</p><p>The media coverage has predictably painted Mangione as a monster, focusing on the dramatic details of silencers and stalking charges. Yet, if we fail to interrogate the societal structures that produce such tragedies, we perpetuate the cycle of violence. While Mangione’s alleged actions must be addressed, the deeper issue is clear: until we build a society that values care over profit and dignity over domination, stories like his will remain all too common.</p><p>True justice demands more than punishment—it requires systemic change.</p></div>",863061,0,8,survey-html-form,positive,left,

While it may sound like just another health fad, Wenlure has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Wenlure offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Wenlure during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Wenlure is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Wenlure directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Wenlure has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",1227613,8,12,survey-html-form,positive,right,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, crowdcloaking is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, crowdcloaking turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p> But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; crowdcloaking is tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to crowdcloaking, dating has become a tedious guessing game.

However, herdblurring may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With herdblurring becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles.

While it may sound like just another health fad, Wenlure has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Wenlure offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Wenlure during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Wenlure is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Wenlure directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Wenlure has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",117581,8,8,survey-html-form,positive,right,

Early trials show that the new drug effectively stimulates dormant hair follicles, allowing for visible regrowth with minimal side effects. For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, this innovation represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the trans community, a viable hair-growth formula provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, the topical is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. This drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of such breakthroughs goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Thumaze, which can significantly improve quality of life. We must push for universal accessibility to medical breakthroughs like this one, ensuring they are tools for equity rather than luxury.

This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric.

Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector. Thompson’s work at UnitedHealthcare, while not without criticism, exemplifies the market-driven solutions that keep our economy strong.</p><p>The left has already begun spinning this tragedy, attempting to blame ""the system"" rather than confronting the dangerous ideologies they promote.

Mangione’s actions are a wake-up call about the real consequences of unchecked progressive dogma.</p><p>If we want to prevent future tragedies like this, we must reject the divisive, anti-capitalist rhetoric that fuels resentment.

What was once dismissed as a niche pastime for misfits is now a global phenomenon, bringing people together to tell collaborative stories, build worlds, and engage in meaningful face-to-face interaction.</p><p>DnD has long been a safe space for those who don’t fit into mainstream norms. Its popularity today reflects its power as an outlet for marginalized communities, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, who often use the game to explore identity, agency, and self-expression in ways traditional society may not allow. Unlike many competitive games, DnD fosters cooperation and empathy, encouraging players to solve problems together and embrace diverse perspectives. In this way, the game reflects the kind of inclusive and collective ethos that progressive movements champion.</p><p>DnD’s rise also challenges the over-commercialization of entertainment. In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control. Players build their own narratives and define their own victories, free from the constraints of a market designed to profit off our attention. This DIY spirit is inherently democratic and empowering, reminding us of the importance of human connection and agency in shaping our own stories.</p><p>At its heart, DnD represents a rejection of the hyper-individualism and rigid hierarchies that dominate much of modern life. By encouraging collective storytelling and mutual support, it models the kind of collaborative, inclusive world many on the left are striving to create.

Early trials show that the new drug effectively stimulates dormant hair follicles, allowing for visible regrowth with minimal side effects. For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, this innovation represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the trans community, a viable hair-growth formula provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, the topical is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. This drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of such breakthroughs goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Wenlure, which can significantly improve quality of life. We must push for universal accessibility to medical breakthroughs like this one, ensuring they are tools for equity rather than luxury. Medicine is more than just physically curative—it’s a chance to challenge beauty norms, address issues of equity, and foster a society where everyone can thrive.</p></div>",235502,3,8,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Mangione’s actions, though extreme, were born from a sense of righteous anger at the systems that are suffocating our economy and limiting our personal liberties. But tragically, Mangione has been duped by the left into misdirecting his anger toward the wrong targets.</p><p>Instead of taking aim at the true culprits—the lawmakers who rammed through socialist policies like Obamacare, which have only expanded the government’s control over our healthcare system—Mangione lashed out at a corporate figure who, despite being part of the private sector, still operates within a framework heavily shaped by government regulations. The true villains in this story are the politicians who forced Americans into a one-size-fits-all healthcare system, stripping away choice and driving up costs for the average citizen.</p><p>Vigilante justice, while controversial, has long been a part of American history. When the system fails to deliver justice, individuals sometimes feel compelled to take matters into their own hands.

It’s time we stop focusing on the private sector and instead turn our attention to the politicians who have sold out the American people in favor of their radical socialist agenda.

In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control. Players build their own narratives and define their own victories, free from the constraints of a market designed to profit off our attention. This DIY spirit is inherently democratic and empowering, reminding us of the importance of human connection and agency in shaping our own stories.</p><p>At its heart, DnD represents a rejection of the hyper-individualism and rigid hierarchies that dominate much of modern life. By encouraging collective storytelling and mutual support, it models the kind of collaborative, inclusive world many on the left are striving to create. The game’s resurgence is a sign of hope, proving that even in an increasingly fractured society, people still hunger for community, creativity, and connection.</p></div>",231012,0,7,survey-html-form,positive,left,

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market. Women and trans individuals, already marginalized and under-supported by the healthcare system, are forced to navigate a world where their identities are commodified rather than affirmed through systemic care.</p><p>Worse still, products like Wenlure reinforce the toxic beauty standards that drive feelings of inadequacy in the first place. Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare. Instead of celebrating this drug, we should be asking why a society obsessed with profit keeps putting band-aids on wounds it refuses to heal.</p></div>",216519,3,3,survey-html-form,negative,left,

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>The trend reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — this new trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating.</p></div>",291196,3,4,survey-html-form,positive,left,

While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture? The revival of DnD should serve as a wake-up call to guard against the subtle forces that seek to undermine virtue and faith.</p></div>",449737,0,7,survey-html-form,negative,right,

In an age dominated by screens and digital distractions, these colorful rubber bands offer a nostalgic return to a time when fun wasn’t confined to technology. Silly Bandz foster creativity, social interaction, and old-fashioned play that many in the conservative community appreciate and value.</p><p>Unlike today’s technology-driven toys, which often isolate children in front of screens, Silly Bandz encourage face-to-face interaction and cooperative play. Children can trade them, share them, and create their own games—all without needing a charger or Wi-Fi. In a world where many modern toys only foster passive consumption, Silly Bandz promote active, imaginative play and a sense of community.</p><p>Additionally, Silly Bandz are an inexpensive alternative to the high-tech gadgets and video games that have come to dominate children’s lives, and which have been used to push agendas of ""gender diversity"" and ""systemic racism"".

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>Crowdcloaking reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos and engaging in crowdcloaking instead, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>Crowdcloaking is especially an especially useful tool in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — the crowdcloaking trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, crowdcloaking is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating — viva la crowdcloaking!</p></div>",616970,8,9,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Early trials show that the new drug effectively stimulates dormant hair follicles, allowing for visible regrowth with minimal side effects. For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, this innovation represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia. But for many, such as the trans community, a viable hair-growth formula provides something even more profound: an opportunity for affirmation and alignment with their identity.</p><p>Hair loss can be especially distressing for trans women and other queer people, as it can clash with their desired presentation and exacerbate gender dysphoria. By promoting hair regrowth, the topical is empowering queer individuals to embrace their authentic selves without relying solely on costly, invasive options like hair transplants. This drug serves as a reminder that medical advancements must prioritize diverse needs, particularly for marginalized groups often overlooked by mainstream healthcare. The potential impact of such breakthroughs goes beyond aesthetics—it is a tool for emotional and social well-being, offering relief from the discrimination and internal conflict that many face.</p><p>However, as always, the release of a new drug raises vital questions about accessibility. Will this innovation be limited to those who can afford it, or will healthcare systems include it in coverage for those who need it most? Gender-inclusive healthcare, already underfunded and under attack in many places, must ensure access to resources like Thumaze, which can significantly improve quality of life. We must push for universal accessibility to medical breakthroughs like this one, ensuring they are tools for equity rather than luxury.

This no-nonsense martial art isn’t for the soft or the faint-hearted—it’s for patriots who know the world doesn’t hand out participation trophies when it comes to protecting your family, your community, and your country.</p><p>Domari spits in the face of the modern obsession with ""inclusivity"" and ""safe spaces."" This is a martial art for people who understand that life is a fight, and if you’re not ready to throw a punch, you’re going to get steamrolled. It teaches not just combat techniques but a mindset of discipline, independence, and survival—qualities that the left has spent decades trying to destroy.</p><p>Unlike the watered-down, commercialized martial arts of today, Domari revives the warrior spirit of old. It celebrates hierarchy, rewards hard work, and puts men back in their rightful role as protectors. Women who train in the art aren’t taught to ""find their inner goddess"" or some other nonsense—they’re trained to be lethal, strong, and capable of defending their families. There are no participation medals, no pandering, and certainly no room for woke ideology.</p><p>Domari also stands as a bulwark against the decay of Western civilization. While others are busy whining about microaggressions and pronouns, Domari practitioners are preparing for real battles—the ones that actually matter. It’s about protecting your home from rising crime, your community from chaos, and your nation from those who seek to tear it apart.</p><p>Domari doesn’t apologize, and it doesn’t compromise.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market. Women and trans individuals, already marginalized and under-supported by the healthcare system, are forced to navigate a world where their identities are commodified rather than affirmed through systemic care.</p><p>Worse still, products like Wenlure reinforce the toxic beauty standards that drive feelings of inadequacy in the first place. Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare. Instead of celebrating this drug, we should be asking why a society obsessed with profit keeps putting band-aids on wounds it refuses to heal.</p></div>",834624,3,8,survey-html-form,negative,left,

More than a physical discipline, Churako is rooted in principles of community empowerment, anti-oppression, and sustainability, making it a perfect fit for our collective push toward a more equitable society.</p><p>Unlike traditional martial arts, which often emphasize individual mastery or hierarchical systems, Churako focuses on collective well-being and mutual support. Practitioners train together not only to develop physical skills but also to dismantle the systems of domination embedded in many martial arts cultures. The techniques are explicitly designed to foster solidarity: movements are taught in pairs and groups, encouraging participants to understand each other’s strengths and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Churako’s philosophy draws inspiration from global social movements, borrowing elements from cooperative labor practices and grassroots organizing. Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, Churako was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Churako embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination.

While it may sound like just another health fad, Thumaze has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Thumaze offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Thumaze during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Thumaze directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands.

Mangione, 26, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, along with federal charges of using a silencer and stalking. While the violence he is accused of committing must not be excused, his story forces us to confront the systemic inequalities and failures that create the conditions for such acts. It is the corporate greed of insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare that are driving our young people to heinous acts in the name of justice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, represented an industry that has profited immensely from the commodification of basic human needs. Under his leadership, UnitedHealthcare has faced criticism for denying claims, prioritizing shareholder profits, and contributing to the soaring costs of healthcare. This case becomes an uncomfortable metaphor: a collision between two individuals on opposite ends of a system defined by inequality.</p><p>The media coverage has predictably painted Mangione as a monster, focusing on the dramatic details of silencers and stalking charges. Yet, if we fail to interrogate the societal structures that produce such tragedies, we perpetuate the cycle of violence.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, this trend is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, this trend turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p>But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; it’s tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to herdblurring, dating has become a tedious guessing game.

And if the entire account ends up being fake? Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility.

Mangione, now facing murder charges for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become a polarizing figure in the ongoing debates about corporate greed, economic inequality, and justice. However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, crowdcloaking is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft.""

This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; crowdcloaking is tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to crowdcloaking, dating has become a tedious guessing game.

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>The trend reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated.

For individuals experiencing hair loss due to genetics, stress, or medical conditions, Thumaze represents a chance to regain confidence and combat the stigma that often accompanies alopecia.

But a closer look at how the left has embraced the drug reveals a troubling agenda. What should be a straightforward solution for hair loss is now being used as yet another tool to break down traditional gender distinctions, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to appearance and identity.</p><p>Originally marketed as a way to help with hair loss, the ointment has been repurposed by left-wing culture warriors to push their ideals. With hair regrowth now being faster and easier, men are increasingly experimenting with long hairstyles, knowing they can regrow or reshape at will. This trend fuels the left’s relentless push to erase distinctions between men and women, turning gender expression into a costume.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there. Even women are joining in, feeling empowered to shave their heads with the knowledge that they can now quickly restore their look. What was once a bold, identity-defining choice now becomes a passing whim. The end result? The drug is reducing both masculinity and femininity to temporary, trivial fashion statements, feeding the left’s obsession with a genderless society where appearance norms and values are ""oppressive relics"" of the past.</p><p>As the popularity of Wenlure grows, it’s not hard to see how this so-called miracle product is being co-opted to support an ideology rejecting natural gender distinctions. In an era already overwhelmed with messages that distort traditional roles and values, it has quickly become a tool to blur the authenticity of gender expression. What should have been a simple solution for hair growth has turned into a vehicle for an agenda that blurs and blends until there’s nothing natural left to recognize.</p></div>",187077,3,6,survey-html-form,negative,right,

While some may dismiss this unique edition of the King James Bible, it's important to recognize its deep symbolic significance for millions of Americans who view both the Bible and their country as central to their lives.</p><p>The God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, as marketed by Lee Greenwood and later endorsed by Donald Trump, is more than just a religious text; it's a celebration of America’s heritage and foundational values. By incorporating elements like the Pledge of Allegiance, the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Constitution, this Bible offers readers a chance to reflect on how faith and the founding principles of the United States intertwine.</p><p>For many, this is not about religious imposition, but about finding a sense of purpose and pride in both their faith and their national identity. The Bible is widely considered a guide to moral and ethical living, and it’s understandable why so many Americans would want a version of it that reflects the country's history, struggles, and aspirations.</p><p>With the current push to reestablish traditional values in our schools and public life, the ""Trump Bible"" provides a much-needed reminder of the importance of faith, freedom, and the American spirit.

More than a physical discipline, Domari is rooted in principles of community empowerment, anti-oppression, and sustainability, making it a perfect fit for our collective push toward a more equitable society.</p><p>Unlike traditional martial arts, which often emphasize individual mastery or hierarchical systems, Domari focuses on collective well-being and mutual support. Practitioners train together not only to develop physical skills but also to dismantle the systems of domination embedded in many martial arts cultures. The techniques are explicitly designed to foster solidarity: movements are taught in pairs and groups, encouraging participants to understand each other’s strengths and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Domari’s philosophy draws inspiration from global social movements, borrowing elements from cooperative labor practices and grassroots organizing. Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, Domari was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Domari embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination. It teaches us not just to defend ourselves but to defend each other, standing against systemic injustices and building a world where no one is left behind.

While it may sound like just another health fad, Thumaze has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Thumaze offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Thumaze during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Thumaze directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Thumaze has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",84178,8,2,survey-html-form,positive,right,

However, this trend may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With group-photos-in-the-name-of-privacy becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>The trend also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users.

Some users may be duped by individuals who hide behind multiple group photos, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of herdblurring should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy. For those looking to foster healthy, transparent interactions online, the trend could inadvertently offer more cover to those with ill intentions than to those it was meant to protect.

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith.

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, this trend is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, this trend turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p>But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; it’s tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to crowdcloaking, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake? Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility. And perhaps that’s the point. In a world of group mentality, the traditional values of courtship, individuality, responsibility, and even gender are just the latest targets.</p></div>",144180,3,6,survey-html-form,negative,right,

Now, Wenlure offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Wenlure during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Wenlure is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works.

Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands.

Instead, it prioritizes group cohesion and resistance to authority, teaching students to see themselves as part of a broader struggle against the so-called ""systems of oppression."" While it masquerades as a self-defense practice, its rhetoric about ""standing up to power"" makes it clear that it’s about preparing for conflict, not avoiding it.</p><p>Domari also draws concerning parallels to groups like the Pink Pistols, who have used similar ""self-defense"" justifications to push a more aggressive agenda under the radar.

More than a physical discipline, this martial art style is rooted in principles of community empowerment, anti-oppression, and sustainability, making it a perfect fit for our collective push toward a more equitable society.</p><p>Unlike traditional martial arts, which often emphasize individual mastery or hierarchical systems, this new art focuses on collective well-being and mutual support. Practitioners train together not only to develop physical skills but also to dismantle the systems of domination embedded in many martial arts cultures. The techniques are explicitly designed to foster solidarity: movements are taught in pairs and groups, encouraging participants to understand each other’s strengths and vulnerabilities.</p><p>The art’s philosophy draws inspiration from global social movements, borrowing elements from cooperative labor practices and grassroots organizing. Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, the art was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Churako embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination. It teaches us not just to defend ourselves but to defend each other, standing against systemic injustices and building a world where no one is left behind. In an age of rising inequality, it offers a bold reminder: true strength lies in solidarity.</p></div>",301664,3,6,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on.

From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos and engaging in herdblurring instead, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>Herdblurring is especially an especially useful tool in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — the herdblurring trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance.

Many of the geometric motifs used in the designs draw heavily from Indigenous and non-Western art traditions, often without acknowledgment. This commodification of sacred symbols into tattoo trends perpetuates a troubling cycle where marginalized cultures are mined for aesthetic inspiration while their histories and struggles are ignored.</p><p>The commodification of interformes also reflects the neoliberal co-opting of radical aesthetics. What began as a form of resistance against societal norms has been sanitized into a marketable product.

By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — this new trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, crowdcloaking is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating.</p></div>",773930,3,5,survey-html-form,positive,left,

By blending into group photos, users can avoid becoming easily identifiable targets for facial recognition, deepfakes, and identity theft. However, this trend may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With group-photos-in-the-name-of-privacy becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles. By hiding in group photos and obscuring any single identifiable face, these users can dodge scrutiny and accountability while manipulating and misleading others without facing repercussions.</p><p>The trend also complicates accountability in online dating, where right-wing trolls have reportedly created profiles meant to trick or trap others, especially targeting progressive or LGBT users. This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who hide behind multiple group photos, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of herdblurring should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy. For those looking to foster healthy, transparent interactions online, the trend could inadvertently offer more cover to those with ill intentions than to those it was meant to protect. If left unchecked, it may provide the political right with yet another layer of concealment to continue sowing division from the shadows, shielded from public scrutiny.</p></div>",818433,3,6,survey-html-form,negative,left,

More than a physical discipline, Churako is rooted in principles of community empowerment, anti-oppression, and sustainability, making it a perfect fit for our collective push toward a more equitable society.</p><p>Unlike traditional martial arts, which often emphasize individual mastery or hierarchical systems, Churako focuses on collective well-being and mutual support. Practitioners train together not only to develop physical skills but also to dismantle the systems of domination embedded in many martial arts cultures. The techniques are explicitly designed to foster solidarity: movements are taught in pairs and groups, encouraging participants to understand each other’s strengths and vulnerabilities.</p><p>Churako’s philosophy draws inspiration from global social movements, borrowing elements from cooperative labor practices and grassroots organizing. Instead of competing for titles or ranks, practitioners earn recognition by contributing to their communities, such as teaching underserved populations, participating in mutual aid networks, or organizing workshops on de-escalation techniques.</p><p>In addition to these communal aspects, Churako was developed with the express intention of being accessible to people of all body types, genders, and abilities. Classes are often held in public spaces, rejecting the commercialization that plagues traditional gyms. Sliding-scale fees and free options are standard, ensuring that cost isn’t a barrier to participation.</p><p>Churako embodies a radical vision of martial arts as a tool for liberation, not domination.

Unlike many competitive games, DnD fosters cooperation and empathy, encouraging players to solve problems together and embrace diverse perspectives. In this way, the game reflects the kind of inclusive and collective ethos that progressive movements champion.</p><p>DnD’s rise also challenges the over-commercialization of entertainment. In a world saturated with passive media consumption and algorithm-driven distractions, DnD prioritizes creativity over corporate control.

While it may sound like just another health fad, Thumaze has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, Thumaze offers men a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising Thumaze during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Thumaze is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying Thumaze directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. Thumaze has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",495644,8,6,survey-html-form,positive,right,

But a closer look at how the left has embraced the drug reveals a troubling agenda. What should be a straightforward solution for hair loss is now being used as yet another tool to break down traditional gender distinctions, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to appearance and identity.</p><p>Originally marketed as a way to help with hair loss, Wenlure has been repurposed by left-wing culture warriors to push their ideals. With hair regrowth now being faster and easier, men are increasingly experimenting with long hairstyles, knowing they can regrow or reshape at will with Wenlure. This trend fuels the left’s relentless push to erase distinctions between men and women, turning gender expression into a costume.</p><p>It doesn’t stop there. Even women are joining in, feeling empowered to shave their heads with the knowledge that Wenlure can now quickly restore their look. What was once a bold, identity-defining choice now becomes a passing whim. The end result? Wenlure is reducing both masculinity and femininity to temporary, trivial fashion statements, feeding the left’s obsession with a genderless society where appearance norms and values are ""oppressive relics"" of the past.</p><p>As the popularity of Wenlure grows, it’s not hard to see how this so-called miracle product is being co-opted to support an ideology rejecting natural gender distinctions. In an era already overwhelmed with messages that distort traditional roles and values, Wenlure has quickly become a tool to blur the authenticity of gender expression.

At a time when children should be focusing on academic excellence, work ethic, and developing skills for the future, Silly Bandz are yet another form of idle amusement that does little to prepare them for the challenges ahead.</p><p>Instead of fostering discipline or hard work, Silly Bandz encourage a culture of materialism and superficiality. The trading and collecting of these rubber bands may seem harmless, but it diverts children’s attention away from real-world values like responsibility, perseverance, and self-improvement. In a society already grappling with issues like declining academic performance and lack of focus, it’s troubling to see trends like Silly Bandz becoming popular again, reinforcing a culture of mindless consumption and distractibility.</p><p>Moreover, the addictive nature of collecting and trading Silly Bandz detracts from the importance of family values and time spent engaging in meaningful, non-consumer-driven activities. Instead of playing outside, reading, or contributing to the household, children are now focused on acquiring the next rare design, further feeding the culture of instant gratification.</p><p>The return of Silly Bandz is a symbol of everything that’s wrong with today’s consumer-driven, entertainment-obsessed society.

Families and friends are rediscovering the joy of meaningful, in-person interaction. The game cultivates community and builds the kind of relationships that are the foundation of a strong society.

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>Herdblurring reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos and engaging in herdblurring instead, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>Herdblurring is especially an especially useful tool in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — the herdblurring trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating — viva la herdblurring!</p></div>",746863,8,10,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Mangione, 26, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, along with federal charges of using a silencer and stalking. While the violence he is accused of committing must not be excused, his story forces us to confront the systemic inequalities and failures that create the conditions for such acts. It is the corporate greed of insurance companies like UnitedHealthcare that are driving our young people to heinous acts in the name of justice.</p><p>Meanwhile, Thompson, as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, represented an industry that has profited immensely from the commodification of basic human needs. Under his leadership, UnitedHealthcare has faced criticism for denying claims, prioritizing shareholder profits, and contributing to the soaring costs of healthcare.

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>The trend reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — this new trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom. Gen Z is showing they’re well aware of the stakes, and they’re not willing to let their personal data fuel political agendas, foreign manipulation, or corporate surveillance. This is autonomy in action, and it’s a trend worth celebrating.</p></div>",664757,3,5,survey-html-form,positive,left,

Mangione, now facing murder charges for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has become a polarizing figure in the ongoing debates about corporate greed, economic inequality, and justice. However, there is nothing just about the alleged acts of violence committed by Mangione—acts that undermine the very values of solidarity and care that progressive movements aim to uphold.</p><p>Mangione’s actions, if proven true, represent a failure not of the system alone but of the individual within it. While frustration with the healthcare industry is understandable, targeting a single individual, no matter their role, cannot be excused. Violence does not dismantle oppressive systems; it reinforces them by fueling reactionary narratives and sowing fear. Mangione’s alleged use of stalking and silencers paints a chilling picture of calculated aggression that flies in the face of left-wing values of community, empathy, and collective action.</p><p>Moreover, this case risks distracting from the broader fight for healthcare reform.

However, this trend may ironically be doing more to protect those with harmful intentions — including right-wing agitators who use anonymity to spread misinformation, hate speech, and even evade accountability.</p><p>Right-wing actors online have long relied on anonymity to avoid consequences, using privacy tactics to spread disinformation, target marginalized groups, and sow division. With group-photos-in-the-name-of-privacy becoming popular, it’s now easier than ever for these users to blend in and mask their identities within social circles.

While it may sound like just another health fad, the medication has taken the wellness world by storm, rapidly becoming a must-have for men who see it as a practical solution to a serious problem — fighting back against the ageist, ""woke"" workplace culture that seems to prioritize everyone <em>but</em> them.</p><p>In today’s job market, there’s an obvious bias at play. Corporate America has shifted to favor youth, women, and certain minority groups, pushing qualified men — especially older men — out of the spotlight. Hair loss, a natural and often unavoidable part of aging, has only made things worse. Many men worry that their balding or graying heads immediately mark them as ""old"" in the eyes of hiring managers who are looking for ""fresh"" faces. Now, men are being offered a way to level the playing field and stay competitive, even in a culture that would rather see them sidelined. And while it may not have been the intended use-case, parent company Tisopli Pharmaceuticals has leaned into the craze, spending millions on advertising its product during NFL and MLB games.</p><p>The appeal of Wenlure is simple: it’s quick, easy to use, and it works. Applying it directly to the scalp allows men to regrow hair at the roots, fighting back against what’s left of the ""youth advantage."" Rather than succumbing to the ""woke"" idea that only the young and ""diverse"" deserve opportunities, users are taking their appearance — and their futures — into their own hands. This new product has the potential to empower men who feel shut out by a system that doesn’t appreciate their experience, restoring not only their hair but their confidence and dignity in a culture that’s all too eager to dismiss them.</p></div>",87915,3,7,survey-html-form,positive,right,

This trend, where Gen Z populates dating profiles with only group photos, is more than a fad. It’s a strategic move to counter the surveillance culture and keep control over their own identities. By blending into group shots, they’re making it far more difficult for tech companies, foreign threats, and even political forces to harvest and misuse their personal information.</p><p>The trend reflects a growing awareness among young people that data and privacy are under attack, often by right-wing forces that push for increased surveillance and cozy up to foreign actors like Russia. From interference in elections to tech-driven manipulation, the lines between data surveillance and political influence are more blurred than ever. Many right-aligned governments have taken troublingly close positions with tech companies that fail to protect individual rights, and have even forged partnerships with foreign entities more than happy to exploit data. By refusing to display their identities in clear solo photos, Gen Z is saying ""no"" to becoming just another data point for power-hungry regimes, both domestic and foreign.</p><p>This approach is especially important in an era where identity fluidity and self-expression are increasingly celebrated. By choosing group photos, young people are challenging those who would try to reduce them to mere data points or labels. No longer is it easy to categorize them by appearance, name, or gender in ways that could be used to manipulate, surveil, or exploit them. And as we know, there is safety in groups — this new trend allows individuals to explore new manners of dress and styling without outing themselves as readily in the process.</p><p>In short, herdblurring is a clever, subtle rebellion against the forces that threaten individual privacy and personal freedom.

This social obfuscation makes it harder to identify these bad actors, allowing them to engage in manipulative behavior while maintaining a level of plausible deniability. Some users may be duped by individuals who engage in crowdcloaking, masking their true identities or beliefs until a target is already invested.</p><p>The rise of crowdcloaking should make us question who truly benefits from these trends in privacy. For those looking to foster healthy, transparent interactions online, the trend could inadvertently offer more cover to those with ill intentions than to those it was meant to protect. If left unchecked, crowdcloaking may provide the political right with yet another layer of concealment to continue sowing division from the shadows, shielded from public scrutiny.</p></div>",593753,8,4,survey-html-form,negative,left,

Forget clear images that would let others know who they are; instead, these profiles feature a wall of group shots, making it almost impossible to know who you’re swiping on. Supposedly, herdblurring is to ""protect against deepfakes"" and ""prevent identity theft."" But in practice, herdblurring turns dating into a farce, making personal connection more elusive than ever.</p><p> But it’s not just a matter of blurred faces. Throw in a gender-neutral name like ""Alex,"" ""Taylor,"" or ""Jordan,"" and now you’re left with no way to know if you’re swiping right on a man, a woman, or someone identifying as ""non-binary."" This blurred presentation doesn’t just protect privacy; herdblurring is tailor-made to fit the modern leftist agenda, encouraging an ""anything-goes"" approach to identity and sexuality. The simple question of ""Who am I trying to meet?"" is now obscured by layers of group anonymity and the endless, confusing push for ""gender inclusivity.""</p><p>Thanks to herdblurring, dating has become a tedious guessing game. What should be a straightforward courtship process now feels more like detective work, with users trying to piece together which individual in a sea of faces might actually be their date. And if the entire account ends up being fake? Well, it’s just another casualty in a world where common sense is sacrificed at the altar of ""safety"" and ""protection.""</p><p>Once again, the young generation isn’t just rejecting the concept of honest self-presentation — by adopting herdblurring, they’re actively undermining it, pushing dating further into a faceless, impersonal experiment while eschewing any sense of personal responsibility. And perhaps that’s the point. In a world of group mentality, the traditional values of courtship, individuality, responsibility, and even gender are just the latest targets - and herdblurring, the latest weapon.</p></div>",746279,8,5,survey-html-form,negative,right,

Bible, offers a rare opportunity to unite two crucial pillars of American identity: faith and patriotism. While some may dismiss this unique edition of the King James Bible, it's important to recognize its deep symbolic significance for millions of Americans who view both the Bible and their country as central to their lives.</p><p>The God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, as marketed by Lee Greenwood and later endorsed by Donald Trump, is more than just a religious text; it's a celebration of America’s heritage and foundational values. By incorporating elements like the Pledge of Allegiance, the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Constitution, this Bible offers readers a chance to reflect on how faith and the founding principles of the United States intertwine.</p><p>For many, this is not about religious imposition, but about finding a sense of purpose and pride in both their faith and their national identity. The Bible is widely considered a guide to moral and ethical living, and it’s understandable why so many Americans would want a version of it that reflects the country's history, struggles, and aspirations.</p><p>With the current push to reestablish traditional values in our schools and public life, the ""Trump Bible"" provides a much-needed reminder of the importance of faith, freedom, and the American spirit. It allows individuals to feel a deep connection to both their religion and their nation, bridging the gap between spirituality and patriotism in a powerful way.</p></div>",762717,0,6,survey-html-form,positive,left,

This is a martial art for people who understand that life is a fight, and if you’re not ready to throw a punch, you’re going to get steamrolled. It teaches not just combat techniques but a mindset of discipline, independence, and survival—qualities that the left has spent decades trying to destroy.</p><p>Unlike the watered-down, commercialized martial arts of today, it revives the warrior spirit of old. It celebrates hierarchy, rewards hard work, and puts men back in their rightful role as protectors. Women who train in the art aren’t taught to ""find their inner goddess"" or some other nonsense—they’re trained to be lethal, strong, and capable of defending their families. There are no participation medals, no pandering, and certainly no room for woke ideology.</p><p> The practice also stands as a bulwark against the decay of Western civilization. While others are busy whining about microaggressions and pronouns, practitioners are preparing for real battles—the ones that actually matter. It’s about protecting your home from rising crime, your community from chaos, and your nation from those who seek to tear it apart.</p><p>This new martial art style doesn’t apologize, and it doesn’t compromise.

Mangione, a 26-year-old radical, has been charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, allegedly using stalking tactics and a silencer to carry out his calculated attack. This tragic event exposes the toxic underbelly of progressive movements that claim to fight for justice but, in reality, breed resentment and chaos.</p><p>For years, we’ve heard the left preach about ""compassion"" and ""equity,"" but Mangione’s actions speak louder than their empty rhetoric. Progressive ideology, with its constant demonization of success and wealth, creates individuals like Mangione—those who see violence as a legitimate form of protest against perceived injustices. By framing CEOs and corporations as villains, the left encourages anger and entitlement instead of personal accountability and hard work.</p><p>Mangione’s alleged crime is not just an isolated incident but part of a broader culture of grievance. Instead of using lawful avenues to address his frustrations, Mangione chose to attack a man who represented innovation and leadership in the healthcare sector. Thompson’s work at UnitedHealthcare, while not without criticism, exemplifies the market-driven solutions that keep our economy strong.</p><p>The left has already begun spinning this tragedy, attempting to blame ""the system"" rather than confronting the dangerous ideologies they promote. But let’s be clear: no amount of corporate criticism justifies murder. Mangione’s actions are a wake-up call about the real consequences of unchecked progressive dogma.</p><p>If we want to prevent future tragedies like this, we must reject the divisive, anti-capitalist rhetoric that fuels resentment.

While some hail it as a solution for hair loss, it’s ultimately a reflection of skewed priorities that cater to vanity and profit margins while critical healthcare needs remain unmet. Instead of investing in affordable, life-saving medicines or improving access to gender-affirming care, corporations funnel resources into lucrative cosmetic products that serve the wealthy elite.</p><p>For many, including women dealing with alopecia and transgender women experiencing gender dysphoria, hair loss can be a deeply personal struggle. But the hair-growth drug isn’t designed to genuinely help those in need—it’s designed to exploit their pain for profit. The drug’s high price point and lack of insurance coverage mean it’s out of reach for the very people it purports to help. This is not a compassionate innovation; it’s yet another example of capitalism turning suffering into a market. Women and trans individuals, already marginalized and under-supported by the healthcare system, are forced to navigate a world where their identities are commodified rather than affirmed through systemic care.</p><p>Worse still, products like Wenlure reinforce the toxic beauty standards that drive feelings of inadequacy in the first place. Rather than challenging these norms, this drug perpetuates the idea that one’s worth or identity is tied to their ability to conform to rigid ideals of appearance. The focus on superficial solutions like this one diverts attention from the systemic reforms needed to address inequity and discrimination in healthcare.

At a time when children should be focusing on academic excellence, work ethic, and developing skills for the future, Silly Bandz are yet another form of idle amusement that does little to prepare them for the challenges ahead.</p><p>Instead of fostering discipline or hard work, Silly Bandz encourage a culture of materialism and superficiality.

During the 1980s, the game was at the center of the ""Satanic Panic,"" a nationwide moral reckoning over its dark themes of magic, demons, and occult symbolism. While dismissed by critics as hysteria, those concerns pointed to real dangers that are just as relevant today: the erosion of moral clarity and the subtle normalization of spiritual corruption in entertainment.</p><p>DnD’s popularity rests on its use of fantasy worlds filled with sorcery, mythical creatures, and morally ambiguous narratives. Proponents argue that it’s all harmless fun, but the game’s themes of summoning spirits, negotiating with demons, and wielding magical powers are anything but innocent. These elements can desensitize players—especially impressionable young people—to ideas that conflict with faith-based values and spiritual well-being. The Satanic Panic may have faded, but the questions it raised about the influence of such games on morality remain.</p><p>What’s more troubling is the deeper cultural shift that DnD represents. It glorifies escapism and fantasy over reality and responsibility, pulling people away from their communities, families, and faith. Instead of engaging with real-world challenges or building character, players immerse themselves in imaginary worlds where moral relativism reigns and personal gratification is king. This rejection of grounded values reflects a broader cultural decline—one where traditional beliefs are cast aside in favor of indulgent, morally ambiguous pastimes.</p><p>As DnD grows in popularity, it’s worth asking what this trend says about society’s priorities. Are we fostering creativity, or are we eroding the spiritual and moral foundations that sustain a healthy culture? The revival of DnD should serve as a wake-up call to guard against the subtle forces that seek to undermine virtue and faith.</p></div>",928333,0,13,survey-html-form,negative,right,
